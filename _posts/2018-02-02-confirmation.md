One of the best things a parent can do, is fill a child's heart with a good amount of confirmation. Because the world is such that confirmation is hard to give and to find. Most of life lived is unconfirmed. Prepare the child for this hard fact, but also fill their heart with enough confirmation to get a good start. This is indeed a parent's task, because who else will?
