title: Javascript is the best
---

Creativity and security are two orthogonal aspects for a programming language. You can go either way: go with the secure way, and let the language be a solid instance of understood design patterns and architectures, or go the "open" way and leave open as much space as possible, thereby allowing for natural growth as much as possible. Javascript has shown to be pretty damn good in the latter sense! All kinds of conceptual patterns have been studied and developed in it. I am especially enthusiastic about d3, which seems to be a very sharp and intelligent act of combining, in a very coherent yet also almost hackish way, the best of various systems: the DOM and the browser's CSS styling, an incredible amount of functional programming, and a great amount of "cut and paste" / "wire it together as you wish" -ability, due to imperative programming, leaky abstractions, untypedness, etc. Funky! And an incredible achievement in innovation.

I love javascript, because it is a programming language for creativity.
