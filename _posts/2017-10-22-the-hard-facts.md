- Even though the grounds are so fertile, and the photos of the photo albums so incredibly beautiful, the people so bizarrely unique and the situations so incredibly beautiful. Even though the world seems to burst with possibility, color and vibrance, and all the people have been put in place so determinedly. Even though all this is the case, the possibilities do not materialize, the people do not connect, the full life is not lived, and nothing grand is built for sheer lack of the possibility for such a thing. Humans are simply too complicated, unable to emancipate themselves, express themselves, communicate with themselves and others, and lack the emotional and organizational resources to enrichen themselves and their communities satisfactorily. In short, humankind has a case of misanthropy and limited abilities.
