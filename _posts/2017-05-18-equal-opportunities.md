A thought:

On watching the first personal introduction in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISfZ3IauNpU], the guy who, from a somewhat simplistically nerdy tech-believing attitude, created change.org (& some more) --- made me think again of the way in which IT would or would not empower people to do good, the basic assumption of which I indeed have is that it makes no fundamental difference. But trying to solve it to the positive, and musing on the good intention of having people like this guy be able to do this kind of stuff, and thus thinking of Hobbes' view of an equal playing ground (natural anarchy) -- I tried to set a difference. And maybe it is exactly that:

We know that human nature is such that, if systematically well-empowered, it creates good (how?), and if left to its natural merits in a basic nature state, it creates evil (out of necessity, then wrong power). ...

Maybe equal opportunities in problem solving is not the same playing ground as equal opportunities in survival.
