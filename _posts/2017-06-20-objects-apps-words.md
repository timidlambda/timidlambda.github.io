Why the paradigm of object oriented programming is so effective, is because the *object* is a very potent conceptuality, in being the *locus and encapsulation of control, logic, and/or just data*.

Why *apps* have become the main guiding architectural principle of modern user tech? Because this architecture is the (simple) unification of two needs:
- The possibility for a multitude of "entry points", or loci, of things structured. A daily task (browsing, note taking), but also an organizational need (planning driving lessons, ...), or an entity (NS, DUO, ..)
- A flattening structure, that places all things in the same arena.

Think of language in the same manner, in which words are the loci of a variety of things. They do not even form a conceptual whole. A word can stand for an object, or a thought, an emotion, a reified social structure, an organization, a friend, a verb, a logical entity, etc. But they compete, as it were, on equal footing. They are all words, and no conceptual distinction restricts one from stringing them together in new, novel forms, which have the power of changing our conceptions in the first place.

As words, so do objects, and apps, display this power of being the basic units of thought, on which one can project many entirely different kinds of things. Most interestingly indeed, they can hold notions of computation, logic, data, location, etc.
