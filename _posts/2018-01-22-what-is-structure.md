title: What is structure?
---

**What is structure even?**

-> Something that one can envisage // but not everything that one envisages; no, only those things that one can "understandably envision", i.e. have a *determined* idea of, i.e. *functionally transform*, i.e. compute.

(Structure = that which is computable)

**But then, what is type theory?**

-> Logic. Is the def of logic open? Yes. Because logic (in it's original conception) went from " those things that are true" to "those things that can be validly argued for" to "those things that our language recognizes" to "those things computable in our language" to just "computable things". Hence, type theory = logic = the study of what is computable.
