Cognition

Using the thought nuggets:
- It's not so much willpower but habits and environment that determine what is commonly attributed to "a strong will." (Which I got from some NY times popular science article.)
- It's not immorality that drives those (passively) inflicting pain (i.e. Laura's mom), etc. (This cannot be true and/or nothing is gained from this stance apart from a particular kind of molding of the individual's behavior, such as in religion.) (My thought)
- Our society has a "character based" past and a "personality based" current, and the transition is historically grounded in urbanisation and changing cultural organization. (TED talk on introvertism.) Both are focused on the individual scale though, and this is logical for reasons of feasibility and control (wording?), and has a lineage in religion.
