Seen as similar in nature: a search of truth. However rationality might be able to discover higher truths than art, as art may be inable to formulate truths of a higher kind.

Seen as a social phenomenon, a struggle of persuasiveness.
A self-fulfilling intentionless system: the method being more persuasive will survive, but what is truth?

Seen as a question of where truth lies. The struggle between these methods is a question of the nature of truth.
