The theory of propositional meaning has been a major, possibly most singularly important, though neurotic, development in Western thought. On itself, it has surely demonstrated its validity, utility, and fecundity. Riddled as it is with self-created paradoxes and other problems, one may sometimes wonder whether what other fundamental perspectives compete.

In fact, as any theory explaining reality, it, too, is perfectly susceptible to comprehension within / reduction to another theory. Slowly, these alternative approaches are being uncovered, e.g. Habermas' view that propositional meaning is parasitic upon lifeworld discourse (?).
