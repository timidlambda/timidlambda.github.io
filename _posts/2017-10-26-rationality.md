Ever since the Greeks discovered syllogisms, Western culture has prided itself with the finding of rationality. In fact, rationality has become the mold of society and individual, and hence can almost not be distinguished from truth and meaning. However, we're now learning the glaringly obvious fact that, at one and the same time, (a) that rationality is a much a social construct as all others, and (b) that rationality is not something inherent to ourselves (other than our having evolutionally acquired it, that is to say), but to the universal notion of computation.

(a)
This is what it means for Western society to have rationalized. It is the fact that our particular quality judgement, something inherent to any society, is based on one's ability to think, but maybe more importantly, behave, rationally. It is what Weber refers to when he speaks of the import of Protestant work-ethic.

(b)
From developments in logic and type theory, we know that our mathematical notion of rationality is just an approximation of computation. Rationality is the stratification, the making accessible, making understandable, of pure computation.
