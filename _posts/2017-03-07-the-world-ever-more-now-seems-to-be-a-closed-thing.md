The world ever more now seems to be a closed thing. Closed, by not being able to break our own chains. If linguistics provides us with a lens pointed towards the past, teaching us very intimately where/how (the structure of) our motives of thought begin -- and type theory and other such things seem to be a major part of it -- and we're just now learning how deeply connected type theory and geometry are -- well, isn't it just slightly embarrassing how contradictory our feeling of independence is compared to this, let us say newly discovered, deeply introverted and timeless sense of the arrangement of the world. We have learned to understand, and now we understand the shape and form of our understanding, but what does this give us exactly? Is it discovery?
